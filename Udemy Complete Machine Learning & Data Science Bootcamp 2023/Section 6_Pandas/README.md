In the file titled `introduction-to-pandas.ipynb` this was dedicated to exploring how the pandas library worked. I explored the various types on pandas datatypes, the anotomy of a dataframe and learning how to analyze the data using methods such as `.mean()`, `.sum()`,  `.describe()` and more. I learnt how to view and select the data. Lastly, I learnt about performing data manipulation.


In the file titled `pandas-exercises.ipynb`, I did the practice exercises as part of the course. 

In the file titled `pandas-exercises-solutions.ipynb`, this was the solution as part of the course given by the course instructor.
