# Section on Matplot library

In the file titled **`Section8_matplot.ipynb`**, this was dedicated to exploring how the Matplot library worked. I explored the following:

-	Creating plots 
-	Plotting data (NumPy arrays), line, scatter, bar, hist, subplots
-	Plotting data directly with Pandas (using the pandas matplotlib wrapper) 
-	Plotting data (pandas DataFrames) with the OO method, line, scatter, bar, hist, subplots
-	Cutomizing your plots, `limits`, `colors`, `styles`, `legends`
-	Saving plots

In the file titled **`matplotlib-exercises.ipynb`**, I did the practice exercises as part of the course. 

In the file titled **`matplotlib-exercises-solutions.ipynb`**, this was the solution as part of the course given by the course instructor.
