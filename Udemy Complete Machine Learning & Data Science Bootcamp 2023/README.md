# Machine Learning Directory

This directory here mainly delves into my knowledge of machine learning. 

Notable projects are:
- **`Section11_MilestoneProject1_Heart_Disease_Prediction`**: Where I created a model using Scikit-Learn machine learning library to predict how likely someone is going to get a heart disease such that preventive measures can be taken early
- **`Section12_MilestoneProject2_Bulldozer_Price_Prediction`**: Where I created a model using Scikit-Learn machine learning library to predict the price of bulldozers as this is a regression based problem.
- **`Section14_DeepLearning_Dog_Vision`**: I created a deep learning model using TensorHub, where I used transfer learning to be a multi-classifier for different dog breeds.

The remaining files are practices on each of the libraries it is named after and not projects.
