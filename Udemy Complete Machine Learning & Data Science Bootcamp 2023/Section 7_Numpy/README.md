# Numpy Section

In the file titled **`introduction-to-numpy.ipynb`**, this was dedicated to exploring how the Numpy library worked. I explored the following:
-	NumPy datatypes & attributes
-	Creating arrays
-	Viewing arrays & matrices (indexing)
-	Manipulating & comparing arrays. Through arithmetic operations, broadcasting and aggregation. This also involved reshaping, transposing and dot product.
-	Sorting arrays
-	Use cases (examples of turning images into numbers)


In the file titled **`numpy-exercises.ipynb`**, I did the practice exercises as part of the course. 

In the file titled **`numpy-exercises-solutions.ipynb`**, this was the solution as part of the course given by the course instructor.
