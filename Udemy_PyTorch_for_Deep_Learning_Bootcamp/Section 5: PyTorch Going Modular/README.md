# Description

* `05_pytorch_going_modular_cell_mode_video.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates how to refactor existing PyTorch code into a modular structure. It guides users through organizing code into separate Python scripts, such as `data_setup.py` for data loading, `model_builder.py` for model architecture, and `train.py` for the training loop. The notebook emphasizes the benefits of modularization, including improved code readability and easier debugging.

* `05_exercise_pytorch_going_modular_template.ipynb`: Serving as a hands-on exercise, this notebook provides a template for users to practice modularizing their PyTorch projects. It includes placeholders and instructions to help users create their modules for data processing, model definition, and training routines. By completing this exercise, users can reinforce their understanding of code modularization and apply best practices in organizing machine-learning projects.
