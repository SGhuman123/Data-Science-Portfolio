# TensorFlow Portfolio

This is a data science portfolio consisting of all the data science related works that I have done in TensorFlow.

Notable projects are:
- **` Section 8: PyTorch Paper Replicating`**: In this project the goal was to **replicate the [Vision Transformer (ViT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) architecture/paper** from scratch with PyTorch.
- **` Section 9: Model Deployment`**: I wanted to deploy my model from section 8 onto the Gradio Platform for users to experiment with.

The remaining files are concepts and practices I dabbled with as part of the course.
