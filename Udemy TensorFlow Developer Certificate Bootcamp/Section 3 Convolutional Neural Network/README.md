# Convolutional Neural Network

The file titled ` 03_CNN.ipynb` was dedicated to learning about computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. I learnt the use cases of such a network for cases such as:

* Classify whether a picture of food contains pizza üçï or steak ü•© (we're going to do this)
* Detect whether or not an object appears in an image (e.g. did a specific car pass through a security camera?)

The following was covered:

- Getting a dataset to work with
- Architecture of a convolutional neural network
- A quick end-to-end example (what we're working towards)
- Steps in modelling for binary image classification with CNNs
  - Becoming one with the data
  - Preparing data for modelling
  - Creating a CNN model (starting with a baseline)
  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)
  - Evaluating a model
  - Improving a model
  - Predicting with a trained model
- Steps in modelling for multi-class image classification with CNNs
 - Same as above (but this time with a different dataset)

In the file titled ` 03_Practice_CNN.ipynb` this was my solution to the practice problem I had to do as part of the course exercise.
