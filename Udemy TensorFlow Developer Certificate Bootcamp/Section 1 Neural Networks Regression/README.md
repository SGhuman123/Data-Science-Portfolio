# Neural Networks Regression

The file titled ` 01_neural_network_regression_with_tensorflow.ipynb` was dedicated to learning about neural network regression. I learnt about how to define a regression problem and when might it be possible to treat a problem as a regression problem. 

The following was covered:

- Architecture of a regression model
- Input shapes and output shapes
  - `X`: features/data (inputs)
  - `y`: labels (outputs)
- Creating custom data to view and fit
- Steps in modelling
  - Creating a model
  - Compiling a model
    - Defining a loss function
    - Setting up an optimizer
    - Creating evaluation metrics
  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)
- Evaluating a model
  - Visualizing the model ("visualize, visualize, visualize")
  - Looking at training curves
  - Compare predictions to ground truth (using our evaluation metrics)
- Saving a model (so we can use it later)
- Loading a model


In the file titled ` 01_Exercises_neural_network_regression.ipynb` this was my solution to the practice problem I had to do as part of the course exercise.
