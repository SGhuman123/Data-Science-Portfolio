# Time Series Bitpredict Project üí∞üìà

In the file titled ` 10_time_series_forecasting_with_tensorflow_video.ipynb` this was to get familiar with working with time series data in an attempt to predict the price of Bitcoin. Time series problems deal with data overtime.

| Problem Type | Examples | Output |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Classification** | Anomaly detection, time series identification (where did this time series come from?) | Discrete (a label) |
| **Forecasting** | Predicting stock market prices, forecasting future demand for a product, stocking inventory requirements | Continuous (a number) |

**The following was covered:**

* Get time series data (the historical price of Bitcoin)
  * Load in time series data using pandas/Python's CSV module
* Format data for a time series problem
  * Creating training and test sets (the wrong way)
  * Creating training and test sets (the right way)
  * Visualizing time series data
  * Turning time series data into a supervised learning problem (windowing)
  * Preparing univariate and multivariate (more than one variable) data
* Evaluating a time series forecasting model
* Setting up a series of deep learning modelling experiments
  * Dense (fully-connected) networks
  * Sequence models (LSTM and 1D CNN)
  * Ensembling (combining multiple models together)
  * Multivariate models
  * Replicating the N-BEATS algorithm using TensorFlow layer subclassing
* Creating a modelling checkpoint to save the best performing model during training
* Making predictions (forecasts) with a time series model
* Creating prediction intervals for time series model forecasts
* Discussing two different types of uncertainty in machine learning (data uncertainty and model uncertainty)
* Demonstrating why forecasting in an open system is BS (the turkey problem)

> The two terms you should be familiar with, **horizon** and **window**.
  * **horizon** = number of timesteps to predict into future
  * **window** = number of timesteps from past used to predict **horizon**

Some of the models experimented with involved:

| Model Number | Model Type | Horizon size | Window size | Extra data |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0 | Na√Øve model (baseline) | NA | NA | NA |
| 1 | Dense model | 1 | 7 | NA |
| 2 | Same as 1 | 1 | 30 | NA |
| 3 | Same as 1 | 7 | 30 | NA |
| 4 | Conv1D | 1 | 7 | NA |
| 5 | LSTM | 1 | 7 | NA |
| 6 | Same as 1 (but with multivariate data) | 1 | 7 | Block reward size |
| 7 | [N-BEATs Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10437.pdf) | 1 | 7 | NA |
| 8 | Ensemble (multiple models optimized on different loss functions) | 1 | 7 | NA |
| 9 | Future prediction model (model to predict future values) | 1 | 7 | NA|
| 10 | Same as 1 (but with turkey ü¶É data introduced) | 1 | 7 | NA |

The file titled ` 10_timeSeries_Practice.ipynb` also encapsulates my solution to the practice problem I had to do as part of the course exercise. This involved the following:

1. Does scaling the data help for univariate/multivariate data? (e.g. getting all of the values between 0 & 1)
    * Try doing this for a univariate model (e.g. model_1) and a multivariate model (e.g. model_6) and see if it effects model training or evaluation results.
2. Get the most up to date data on Bitcoin, train a model & see how it goes (our data goes up to May 18 2021).
    * You can download the Bitcoin historical data for free from  [coindesk.com/price/bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin)  and clicking ‚ÄúExport Data‚Äù -> ‚ÄúCSV‚Äù.
3. For most of our models we used WINDOW_SIZE=7, but is there a better window size?
    * Setup a series of experiments to find whether or not there‚Äôs a better window size.
    * For example, you might train 10 different models with HORIZON=1 but with window sizes ranging from 2-12.
4. Create a windowed dataset just like the ones we used for model_1 using  [tf.keras.preprocessing.timeseries_dataset_from_array()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array)  and retrain model_1 using the recreated dataset.
5. For our multivariate modelling experiment, we added the Bitcoin block reward size as an extra feature to make our time series multivariate.
    * Are there any other features you think you could add?
    * If so, try it out, how do these affect the model?
6. Make prediction intervals for future forecasts. To do so, one way would be to train an ensemble model on all of the data, make future forecasts with it and calculate the prediction intervals of the ensemble just like we did for model_8.
7. For future predictions, try to make a prediction, retrain a model on the predictions, make a prediction, retrain a model, make a prediction, retrain a model, make a prediction (retrain a model each time a new prediction is made). Plot the results, how do they look compared to the future predictions where a model wasn‚Äôt retrained for every forecast (model_9)?
