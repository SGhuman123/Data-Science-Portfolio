# Neural Network Classification

In the file titled ` 02_neural_network_classification_with_tensorflow.ipynb` this was dedicated to learning about neural network classification. I learnt about how to define a classification problem and when might it be possible to treat a problem as a classification problem. 

The following was covered:
- Architecture of a classification model
- Input shapes and output shapes
  - `X`: features/data (inputs)
  - `y`: labels (outputs)
    - "What class do the inputs belong to?"
- Creating custom data to view and fit
- Steps in modelling for binary and multiclass classification
  - Creating a model
  - Compiling a model
    - Defining a loss function
    - Setting up an optimizer
      - Finding the best learning rate
    - Creating evaluation metrics
  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)
  - Improving a model
- The power of non-linearity
- Evaluating classification models
  - Visualizing the model ("visualize, visualize, visualize")
  - Looking at training curves
  - Compare predictions to ground truth (using our evaluation metrics)

In the file titled `02_Exercise_neural_network_classification_with_tensorflow.ipynb` this was my solution to the practice problem I had to do as part of the course exercise.
