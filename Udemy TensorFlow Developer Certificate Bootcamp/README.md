# TensorFlow Portfolio

This is a data science portfolio consisting of all the data science related works that I have done in TensorFlow.

Notable projects are:
- **`Section 7 Food Vision Big Project`**: In this project it was dedicated to the goal of beating DeepFood, a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy. Where I managed to achieve an accuracy of 82.8%
- **`Section 8 Introduction to NLP`**: In this project, I created a model to be used in the compeition called [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data). I managed to achieve an f1-score of 0.81673 and raking in global rank of 286 as of 13 June 2024.
- **`Section 9 Skimlit NLP Project`**: I wanted to make reading medical abstracts easier. As such, I wanted sections of a paragraph to be broken down into `[OBJECTIVE, METHODS, RESULTS, CONCLUSION]`.
- **`Section 10 Time Series Bitpredict Project`**: Where I wanted to create a model to help predict the price of Bitcoin.

The remaining files are concepts and practices I dabbled with as part of the course.
