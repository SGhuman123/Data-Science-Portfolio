# TensorFlow Fundamentals

In the file titled `00_tensorflow_fundamentals.ipynb` this was dedicated to exploring how the Tensorflow library worked. I learnt about the different datatypes of tensors being scalar, vectors and matrixes.

I also learnt how to shuffle the order of elements in a tensor. Moreover, I learnt about how to turn NumPy arrays into Tensors and how to extrapolate information on shape, rank and size from Tensors. I then learnt about indexing tensors and manipulating tensors through tensor operations (`+`, `-`, `/`, `*`).

Moreover, I learnt about matrix multiplication and dot product. I also utilized aggregation which involves finding the min, max, mean and sum on the whole tensor. On top of that, I found the positional maximum and minimum. Lastly, I found out how to squeeze a tensor (remove all single dimensions) and about one-hot encoding.

In the file titled ` 00_Exercises_TensorFlow_Fundamentals.ipynb ` this was my solution to the practice problem I had to do as part of th course exercise.
