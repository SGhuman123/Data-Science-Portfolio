# Food Vision Big Project

In the file titled ` 07_1_Milestone_Project.ipynb ` this was dedicated to **the goal of beating [DeepFood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304163308_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment)**, a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.

> ðŸ”‘ **Note:** **Top-1 accuracy** means "accuracy for the top softmax activation value output by the model" (because softmax ouputs a value for every class, but top-1 means only the highest one is evaluated). **Top-5 accuracy** means "accuracy for the top 5 softmax activation values output by the model", in other words, did the true label appear in the top 5 activation values? Top-5 accuracy scores are usually noticeably higher than top-1.

**"As is" transfer learning** is when you take a pretrained model as it is and apply it to your task without any changes.

**Feature extraction transfer learning** is when you take the underlying patterns (also called weights) a pretrained model has learned and adjust its outputs to be more suited to your problem.

In **fine-tuning transfer learning** the pre-trained model weights from another model are unfrozen and tweaked during to better suit your own data.


We are going to learn about two methods to significantly improve the speed of our model training:
1. Prefetching
2. Mixed precision training

The following is covered:

* Using TensorFlow Datasets to download and explore data
* Creating preprocessing function for our data
* Batching & preparing datasets for modelling (**making our datasets run fast**)
* Creating modelling callbacks
* Setting up **mixed precision training**
* Building a feature extraction model (see [transfer learning part 1: feature extraction](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/04_transfer_learning_in_tensorflow_part_1_feature_extraction.ipynb))
* Fine-tuning the feature extraction model (see [transfer learning part 2: fine-tuning](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/05_transfer_learning_in_tensorflow_part_2_fine_tuning.ipynb))
* Viewing training results on TensorBoard
