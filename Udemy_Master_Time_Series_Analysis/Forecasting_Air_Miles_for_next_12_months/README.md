This notebook is focused on Time Series Forecasting using the Holt-Winters method, also known as Triple Exponential Smoothing. It uses the 'airmiles' dataset to demonstrate the process.

> **The aim is to forecast the Airmiles taken by passengers in the future horizon of 12 months. It involves the following steps:**


1. Data Loading and Preparation:

    * The notebook starts by loading the airmiles.csv dataset.
    * It sets the 'Date' column as the index and converts the index to monthly frequency ('MS').
    * Renames the target column to 'y'.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

    * Visualizations are used to understand the data's patterns. This includes:
    * Line plot of monthly air miles.
    * Monthly and quarterly seasonality plots using month_plot and quarter_plot.
    * Decomposition plot using seasonal_decompose to identify trend, seasonality, and residuals.
    * Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots to understand correlation patterns within the data.

3. Holt-Winters Modeling:

    * The data is split into training and testing sets, with the last 12 months used for testing.
    * An exponential smoothing model with multiplicative trend and seasonality is created, considering a seasonal period of 12 months.
    * The model is trained on the training data to forecast values for the test period.

4. Model Assessment:

    * The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
    * A function model_assessment is defined to plot the training, test, and forecast data along with calculating and printing the metrics.

5. Future Predictions:

    * The Holt-Winters model is retrained on the entire dataset to forecast future values.
    * The plot_future function is used to visualize the training data and the future forecasts.
