# Description:



> **Notes:**
> Before loading the dataset `hotel_bookings.csv` into Postgres, I noticed that there were 4 NA values in the children column which was causing loading difficulties. As such, I cleaned the CSV using Excel manually and created a new CSV file called `hotel_bookings_2.csv`.
