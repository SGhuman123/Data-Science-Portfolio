# Description of SQL Task Done

> **Notes:**
> Prior to loading the dataset `hotel_bookings.csv` into Postgres, I noticed that there were 4 NA values in the children column which was causing loading difficulties. As such, I cleaned the csv using Excel manually and created a new csv file called `hotel_bookings_2.csv`.
